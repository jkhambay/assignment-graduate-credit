Controllers for CRUD Operations:

This exercise problem/express application gives you practice of writing controllers for 9 CRUD operations using mongoose/MongoDB. The "find" operation is implemented as an example. The application is an address book where once can create / read / update / delete a contact. There are 3 fields for each contact - name, address and phone.

Pre-requisites:
1.	Execute "npm install" in your terminal after downloading the starter code
2.	Setup MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Compass Community
3.	Add DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD in .env file
4.	Update connect string in app.js
5.	Pug template engine

Express generator can be used. Starter code is available at: https://github.com/jkhambay/assignment-graduate-credit-jkhambay and the controller code to be completed is at https://github.com/jkhambay/assignment-graduate-credit-jkhambay/blob/master/controllers/addressbookController.js

The starter code provides the following completed files: 
1.	app.js
2.	views
3.	routes
4.	models

The only file that needs to be completed is addressbookController.js, by implementing a function for each of the operations/routes that are stated in the starter code. There should not be a need to change any other file to make this work.

Solution:

The solution is available at: https://github.com/jkhambay/assignment-graduate-credit-jkhambay/blob/master/solution/addressbookController.js

This file can be copied to controllers directory to replace the practice addressbookController.js
